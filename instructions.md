This project demonstrates the use of [nsepy libray](https://nsepy.xyz/) for extracting data related to Indian stocks and subsequently using [Pytorch LSTMs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html) for building a time series forecasting model in order to predict future prices given current price / past n days prices.

In order to get a detailed overview of this project, please refer [this medium article]().

This application lets you experiment with different hyperparameters for building a pytorch model with different NSE stocks which you can select and check for yourself. A small description of the hyperparameters is provided below.
